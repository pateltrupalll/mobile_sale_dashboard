1 Project Description

This project is a comprehensive and interactive Power BI Sales Dashboard developed to analyze and visualize sales data using advanced analytics techniques. The dashboard transforms raw sales data into actionable business insights through dynamic visuals, DAX calculations, custom calendar creation, and time intelligence reporting.

The project demonstrates end-to-end Power BI development, covering data preparation, data modeling, DAX measures, Month-to-Date (MTD) analysis, and Same Period Last Year (SPLY) comparisons, along with professional dashboard design.

2 Business Problem

Businesses often struggle to:
Track current month performance in real time,Compare current sales with the same period in previous years,Identify growth or decline trends quickly,Perform accurate time-based analysis,This dashboard addresses these challenges by providing MTD performance reports and year-over-year comparisons, enabling faster and more informed decision-making.

3 Project Objectives

Analyze overall sales and revenue performance,Track Month-to-Date (MTD) sales metrics,Compare current performance with Same Period Last Year (SPLY),Implement advanced DAX time intelligence,Use a custom calendar table for accurate date analysis,Create multiple dashboards for deeper insights,Build a professional Power BI portfolio project

4 Key Metrics (KPIs)

Total Sales,Total Revenue,Total Orders,Average Order Value (AOV),Month-to-Date (MTD) Sales,Same Period Last Year (SPLY) Sales,Category-wise & Region-wise Performance

5 DAX Formulas & Time Intelligence Used

The project uses advanced DAX measures to create dynamic calculations, including:
Total Sales & Revenue,Total Orders Count,Average Order Value (AOV),MTD Sales, Revenue, and Orders,Same Period Last Year (SPLY) Sales,Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth %,Running / Cumulative Totals,Percentage Contribution by Category & Region,All measures respond dynamically to slicers and filters.

6 Custom Calendar Table

A custom calendar table was created using DAX to enable accurate and efficient time intelligence analysis.
Calendar Attributes:
Date
Day
Month
Month Name
Quarter
Year
Week Number
Benefits:
Enables MTD, YoY, and SPLY calculations
Improves model performance
Provides better control over time-based reporting
